# Employee Pay Calculation - New Target-Based System

## 🎯 **IMPORTANT: How Your Pay Will Be Calculated From Now On**

Dear Team,

We're implementing a new **target-based payment system** that rewards consistent daily performance. This system is designed to encourage steady, high-quality work while providing fair compensation based on your daily achievements.

---

## 💰 **Payment Structure**

### **Daily Target: 20 Applications**
- **Target Met (≥20 applications/day)**: **$0.20 per application**
- **Below Target (<20 applications/day)**: **$0.15 per application**

### **Key Points:**
- ✅ **Each day is calculated separately** - your performance each day determines your rate for that day
- ✅ **Consistency is rewarded** - meeting the target daily maximizes your earnings
- ✅ **No monthly penalties** - each day stands alone in the calculation

## 📊 **How It Works - Examples**

### **Example 1: Consistent High Performer**
- **Monday**: 25 applications → $0.20 × 25 = **$5.00**
- **Tuesday**: 22 applications → $0.20 × 22 = **$4.40**
- **Wednesday**: 20 applications → $0.20 × 20 = **$4.00**
- **Thursday**: 18 applications → $0.15 × 18 = **$2.70**
- **Friday**: 24 applications → $0.20 × 24 = **$4.80**
- **Weekly Total**: **$20.90**

### **Example 2: Inconsistent Performer**
- **Monday**: 15 applications → $0.15 × 15 = **$2.25**
- **Tuesday**: 8 applications → $0.15 × 8 = **$1.20**
- **Wednesday**: 30 applications → $0.20 × 30 = **$6.00**
- **Thursday**: 5 applications → $0.15 × 5 = **$0.75**
- **Friday**: 12 applications → $0.15 × 12 = **$1.80**
- **Weekly Total**: **$12.00**

**Difference**: The consistent performer earns **74% more** ($20.90 vs $12.00)!

Monthly Pay = (Day 1 Payout) + (Day 2 Payout) + ... + (Day 30 Payout)
```

**Example Monthly Breakdown:**
- **Days meeting target (20+ apps)**: 20 days
- **Days below target**: 10 days
- **Total applications**: 650
- **Calculation**: (20 days × $0.20 × avg apps) + (10 days × $0.15 × avg apps)
