# AI Resume Generator Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The AI-powered resume generator has been successfully implemented allowing employees and admins to generate tailored LaTeX resumes for clients using Gemini AI.

### Recent Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Added `geminiApiKey` to `storage.ts` updateUser method
2. ✅ Modified `/api/auth/user` to fetch fresh user data from database (ensures API key is always current)
3. ✅ Added `refetchQueries` to navigation header after saving API key
4. ✅ Updated to use `@google/genai` package with `gemini-2.5-flash` model (more stable and newer API)

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- Added `geminiApiKey` field to the `users` table in `shared/schema.ts`
- Each employee/admin can store their own Gemini API key
- Schema pushed to database successfully

### 2. Backend API Endpoints ✅
Created two new API endpoints in `server/routes.ts`:

#### PUT `/api/users/:userId/gemini-key`
- Allows users to save their Gemini API key
- Users can only update their own key (security enforced)
- Returns success message on save

#### POST `/api/generate-resume/:clientId`
- Generates tailored resume using Gemini AI
- Requires EMPLOYEE or ADMIN role
- Accepts job description in request body
- Fetches client's base LaTeX resume and user's API key
- Returns generated LaTeX code
- Comprehensive error handling for API issues

### 3. Gemini AI Integration ✅
- Installed `@google/genai` package (newer SDK)
- Uses model: `gemini-2.5-flash` (latest stable model)
- Constructs intelligent prompt combining:
  - Client's base LaTeX resume
  - Job description
  - Expert resume writing instructions
- Cleans up markdown formatting from response

### 4. Frontend Components ✅

#### API Key Settings Dialog
- Added to `navigation-header.tsx`
- Visible only for EMPLOYEE and ADMIN users
- Features:
  - Settings icon button in navigation bar
  - Secure password input with show/hide toggle
  - Link to Google AI Studio for API key generation
  - Save functionality with confirmation toast
  - Cancel option

#### Resume Generator Component
- New file: `client/src/components/resume-generator.tsx`
- Features:
  - Large textarea for job description input
  - Generate button with loading state
  - Validation checks for API key and base resume
  - Error alerts when prerequisites missing
  - Result dialog with:
    - Generated LaTeX code display
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Copy to clipboard button
    - Success notifications

#### Integration with Client Detail Page
- Added to `client/src/pages/client-detail.tsx`
- Appears after base LaTeX resume section
- Only visible to EMPLOYEE and ADMIN roles
- Passes client ID, resume availability, and API key status

### 5. TypeScript Types ✅
- Updated `client/src/types/index.ts` to include `geminiApiKey` field in User type
- Maintains type safety throughout the application

## User Flow

1. **First-Time Setup** (one-time per employee):
   - Employee/admin clicks Settings icon in navigation bar
   - Enters their Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
   - Clicks "Save API Key"
   - Receives confirmation toast

2. **Generating a Resume**:
   - Navigate to a client's detail page (`/clients/:clientId`)
   - Scroll to "AI Resume Generator" section
   - Paste job description into textarea
   - Click "Generate Tailored Resume"
   - Wait for AI generation (typically 3-10 seconds)
   - View generated LaTeX in modal dialog
   - Click "Copy Code" to copy to clipboard
   - Use the LaTeX code for job application

## Error Handling

The system provides clear error messages for:
- ❌ Missing Gemini API key: "Please configure your Gemini API key in settings"
- ❌ Missing base resume: "Client hasn't uploaded a LaTeX resume template"
- ❌ Invalid API key: "Invalid Gemini API key"
- ❌ API quota exceeded: "Gemini API quota exceeded, check your API key"
- ❌ Empty job description: "Please paste a job description first"
- ❌ General generation errors: Displays specific error message

## Files Modified

1. `shared/schema.ts` - Added geminiApiKey field
2. `server/routes.ts` - Added API endpoints and Gemini integration
3. `client/src/components/navigation-header.tsx` - Added settings dialog
4. `client/src/components/resume-generator.tsx` - New component
5. `client/src/pages/client-detail.tsx` - Integrated resume generator
6. `client/src/types/index.ts` - Updated User type
7. `package.json` - Added @google/genai dependency (newer Gemini SDK)

## Testing the Feature

### Prerequisites:
1. Have a client with a base LaTeX resume uploaded
2. Get a Gemini API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### Test Steps:
1. Login as an employee or admin
2. Click the Settings (gear) icon in the navigation bar
3. Enter your Gemini API key and save
4. Navigate to a client detail page
5. Scroll to the "AI Resume Generator" card
6. Paste a sample job description
7. Click "Generate Tailored Resume"
8. Verify the generated LaTeX appears in a modal
9. Click "Copy Code" to test clipboard functionality

### Sample Job Description for Testing:
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored per-user (not shared)
- Users can only update their own API keys
- API key input is masked by default
- Role-based access control enforced
- All API endpoints require authentication

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Resume generation history/logging
