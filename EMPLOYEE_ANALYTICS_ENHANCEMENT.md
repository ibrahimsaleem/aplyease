## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`server/storage.ts`)

#### New Methods Added:
1. **`getWeeklyPerformance()`**
   - Calculates performance for last 8 weeks
   - Uses date range queries with `gte` and `lte` operators
   - Counts unique employees using Set data structure

2. **`getDailyPerformance()`**
   - Calculates performance for last 30 days
   - Uses exact date matching
   - Counts unique employees using Set data structure

#### Enhanced Analytics Response:
```typescript
{
  totalPayout: number;
  employees: EmployeePerformanceData[];
  weeklyPerformance: Array<{
    week: string;
    applications: number;
    employees: number;
  }>;
  dailyPerformance: Array<{
    date: string;
    applications: number;
    employees: number;
  }>;
}
```

### Frontend Changes (`client/src/components/employee-performance-analytics.tsx`)

#### New Imports:
- Added `LineChart` and `Line` from recharts
- Added `Calendar` and `Clock` icons from lucide-react

#### New Components:
1. **Weekly Performance Chart**
   - Line chart with dual metrics
   - Custom tooltips showing week information
   - Legend for metric identification

2. **Daily Performance Chart**
   - Line chart with dual metrics
   - Custom date formatting (MM/DD)
   - Detailed tooltips with full date information

3. **Enhanced Summary Cards**
   - Grid layout with 4 cards
   - Color-coded gradients for visual appeal
   - Real-time data from analytics

## Data Structure

### Weekly Performance Data:
```typescript
{
  week: "Week 1" | "Week 2" | ... | "Week 8",
  applications: number,  // Total applications in that week
  employees: number      // Unique employees who submitted applications
}
```

### Daily Performance Data:
```typescript
{
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",    // ISO date string
  applications: number,  // Total applications on that date
  employees: number      // Unique employees who submitted applications
}
```

## Business Value

### 1. Trend Analysis
- Identify weekly and daily patterns in application submissions
- Track employee engagement over time
- Monitor productivity trends

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Compare current week/day performance with historical data
- Identify peak productivity periods
- Track employee participation rates

### 3. Resource Planning
- Understand workload distribution across time periods
- Plan resource allocation based on historical patterns
- Optimize scheduling and expectations

### 4. Management Insights
- Quick overview of current performance metrics
- Historical context for decision making
- Employee engagement tracking

## Access Control
- **Weekly and Daily Charts**: Admin only (same as existing employee analytics)
- **Summary Cards**: Admin only
- **Data Privacy**: All data is aggregated and doesn't expose individual employee details

## Performance Considerations
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Data is calculated on-demand with caching through React Query
- Unique employee counting uses efficient Set data structure
- Date range queries use indexed date columns

## Future Enhancements
Potential areas for future improvement:
1. Export functionality for time-series data
2. Custom date range selection
3. Individual employee time-series tracking
4. Performance alerts and notifications
5. Comparative analysis between time periods
